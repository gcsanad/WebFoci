a)
Honestly, I don't think I would need any qualifications except for logical thinking and basic understanding of certain programming languages.

I need to have a skill in programming languages and I need to be great at solving problems as quickly as possible

I should aquire skills, that are required for software engineering

I need to be the kind of person, that can solve problems quickly and isn't afraid to ask for help from others.

b)

My dream job would be software developement or software engineering

Every job appeals to me that includes interacting with a computer

I would be interestid in a position that requires programming

I would love to have a starting salary of at least 650.000

I think a 9-5 working window would suit me the best.

Of course it's important to me to build a career

I don't really care about any bonuses


Write about your dream job!

I would like to be a software developer. This is my dream job, because it includes everything
I'm passionate about. These are, programming, computers and improving in these areas.
A big advantage of this job is that I could work remotely from any part of the world.
I could work for any company, that doesn't require that I'm phisically there at the workplace.
I would also love to work for a "tech giant" for example, Nvidea, Intel or Google.
I imagine my employment contract to be mostly positive. By that I mean that my salary would be
enough for me to make a living out of it. With regard to the workplace, I could work in a team,
or alone. I don't mind either, I think I'm a great team player, but I also excell at working alone.
